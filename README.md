# Gimmic-Robot-Personal-Assistant-Robot-
GIMMIC is a type of  Intelligent Personal  Assistant robot that can perform tasks, or services, on behalf of an individual. Based on a combination of user input, location awareness, and the ability to access information from a variety of online sources, GIMMIC can do tasks efficiently.


### Full Form of Gimmic:

___
### Components Used:
* RaspBerry Pi
* Arduino Mega
* Pi Camera
* Speakers
* Sensors
  * Ultrasonic Sensor
  * Proximity Sensor
  * LDR
* 3D printer (for printing robotic arms, neck, face, and other body parts)
* Motors (for locomotion, neck movement, hand movement, fingers movement, eye movement, shoulder movement, elbow movement, base movement, and lips movement)


___
### Technologies Used:
* Language: Python and C (RaspberryPy - python and C - Arduino IDE).
* Computer Vision: Computer vision is the ability  of a computer to see, analyze and process images. We've used OpenCV to identify objects and faces, and from identifying faces we updated our code in such a way that it can now recognize faces of each individual (once we train it with the existing dataset.)
Dataset - In our dataset, there will be 50 to 80 pictures of an individual, and these pictures will be stored in a seperate file with a unique id. Then, we make use of this unique Id to recognize different faces.

* Arduino IDE



___
### What can Gimmic do?:
* It can move around and assist in your place.
* Can take photos, capture videos and make video calls.
* Speak convenient audible reminders of important information and be an entertaining storyteller for children.
* Can recognize faces (once its trained with the dataset)
* Can move around and detect obstacles which are on its way.
* Can have a healthy conversation with you (although it will only remember the name of the person with whom it had it's first conversation).
* And a lot more...
